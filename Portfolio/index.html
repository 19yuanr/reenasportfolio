                    My name is Reena Yuan, and I am currently a senior at Brookfield Central
                    High School. During junior year, while taking AP Computer Science, I realized
                    I wanted to study computer science in college. Another major reason for this
                    decision is my sister, who has been very successful and inspiring to me in 
                    this field. Besides computer science, I enjoy tennis, piano, and volunteering.

                    Completing the SafeNet problem was a painstaking and frustrating process when I did 
                    it in java months ago. Initially, I thought the code would be very simple and easy, but I 
                    quickly realized that there were many situations to account for, which resulted in many if statements.
                    Making the switch to C# was easier than I thought since they are both object oriented languages.

                    Working on File IO as a team in C# went better than I expected. We were able to find most of the
                    information we needed on the internet, making the switch from Java to C# much easier. Additionally,
                    help from members of other teams made our code much more efficient. For example, we were able to assign
                    the path of the text file to a variable which made it much more accessible. The biggest issue we faced 
                    was dealing with source control on the Macs. Overall, File IO made our team better
                    at C# and more fluent with GitKraken.

                    Javascript was confusing to learn in the beginning, but learning and using the Vue framework made it
                    much easier. When it got time to make the team website, I was very pleased with how our team worked to
                    create a design and complete our own pages. With the time crunch we cut some corners on source control,
                    but we were still able to merge our pages with very little issues.

                        Doing conversions on the server-side was a big leap from client-side unit conversion, and my team had 
                        to make a conceptual leap. Additionally, learning MVC was a bit overwhelming at first. However, I enjoyed
                        helping out team members and becoming more fluent in MVC. Although source control was a bigger issue in this
                        project, it was a successful and fulfilling process.
